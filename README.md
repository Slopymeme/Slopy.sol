Slopy (SLOPY) is a meme token created on the Ethereum blockchain with a dynamic royalty system for holders. Royalties are randomly awarded to holders during transactions.
One of the core features of Slopy is its unique royalty system. During token transfer, a small commission is deducted from the transaction amount and sent to a randomly selected wallet address among the holders of SLOPY tokens.
The Master Wallet is a special wallet status that is exempt from paying any transaction commissions. Master wallet also receives royalties from transactions randomly, just like the TIDY wallet. To qualify for Master Wallet status, an address must hold a specific minimum balance of SLOPY tokens.
